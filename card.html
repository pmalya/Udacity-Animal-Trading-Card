			<p class="description">The Pug is well described by the phrase "multum in parvo" which means "a lot of dog in a small space." They are recognized for their even-tempers, playful personalities, and their outgoing, loving dispositions. This square and cobby breed comes in fawn or black, with a well-defined "mask" on his muzzle. A popular companion dog, the pug also excels in the show ring.</p>
